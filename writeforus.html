            <p>We have a strict AI policy and will be checking each article with AI checkers. You can use AI to find sources, check grammar, and fact check. You cannot use AI to write any part of your article, conduct research, paraphrase text, or reword sentence. In case your article gets flagged, please be prepared to share version history and previous drafts as evidence. Lack of evidence provided may lead to your disqualification from the contest. We HIGHLY recommend the use of google docs which provides built-in version history.</p>
