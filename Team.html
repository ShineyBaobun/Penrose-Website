            <p>Hi! I’m Cadence, a 21-year-old student from Manitoba, Canada, currently completing the final year of my Bachelor of Science degree. My main area of interest is forensic science, and after graduation, I plan to continue expanding my education in that field. I’m especially passionate about exploring forensic procedures, historical case-solving methods (like those used before DNA testing), and sharing that knowledge with others. Outside of academics, I love anything creative; colouring, crafting, and finding new ways to express myself. I’m always looking for opportunities to grow my personal portfolio and gain valuable experience to strengthen my resume and qualifications.</p>

            <p>My name is Kingston. I am from Malaysia and am currently in sixth form. While I don't study STEM subjects, I am very interested in evolutionary biology, with this interest stemming from reading copious amounts of world building projects. I especially enjoy learning about how organisms have evolved in relation to their local geography, inspiring me to look further into more obscure, exotic examples of animal physiology and behaviour. Part of my dream career is to become a concept artist revolving around fictional biology.</p>
