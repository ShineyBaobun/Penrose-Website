              <p>I’m from Athens, Greece. I’ve loved Maths and Chemistry from a young age, but watching a Falcon 9 launch inspired my dream to build rockets and reach the stars. I’ve served on school councils for six years, played volleyball for eight, and I’m eager to join a STEM-focused team.</p>
